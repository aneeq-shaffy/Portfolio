           Throwing Next.js apps into the React civil war, clueless whether to side with Team Simplicity or Icelandâ€™s Cloud Sales Cult. Accidentally enlisted with Team Iceland â€” kinda scared now, send help, senpai. Currently battling a Next.js vibe-coding mind virus â€” security flops included â€” and reconsidering life choices daily. Slinging code like a drunk catapult operator from Colombo. Applying for internships with cover letters that double as psychological horror stories â€” each one a cry for help wrapped in corporate lingo. Powered by anxiety, bad coffee, and an escalating fear of adult responsibilities. Escaping jobophobia one panicked "submit" click at a time.
